# Android FontMetrics
An Android app for measuring and testing FontMetrics

![App preview](/Xi2UG.png?raw=true)

This app was originally created and used for these Stack Overflow questions:

- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27631736/meaning-of-top-ascent-baseline-descent-bottom-and-leading-in-androids-font
- http://stackoverflow.com/a/42091739/

I decided to put the project on GitHub to make it easier to experiment with, and also so that other people will improve it.

## TODO

If you want to help, here are some improvements that are needed:
- Color code the checkbox items and the lines in the custom view
- Keyboard popping up when first entering app isn't necessary
- Add a few custom (free) fonts and add an option to select different fonts.
